[Live Site](https://grmreyes.github.io/killcount/)


Features
======


## Interactive Pixel Art Minigame
* Kill as many guys as you want, and see who has as many as you.
* Has genre flavors (currently has fantasy and sci fi)
* Programmed on HTML Canvas

*Using a combination of Javascript and CSS, the movie thumbnails expand, play a preview, and show further information about the movie when moused over by the user. This is accomplished by using CSS to enlarge the thumbnail and show the movie's information (runtime, mpaa rating, and genres) while javascript handles the playback, stopping, and muting of the background movie video.*


## Movie/TV Character Kill Count Record
* Uses CSS and Javascript Transitions to present characters and kill counts
